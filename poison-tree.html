          <p>I was angry with my friend;<br>
          I told my wrath, my wrath did end.<br>
          I was angry with my foe:<br>
          I told it not, my wrath did grow.</p>

          <p>And I waterd it in fears,<br>
          Night & morning with my tears:<br>
          And I sunned it with smiles,<br>
          And with soft deceitful wiles.</p>

          <p>And it grew both day and night.<br>
          Till it bore an apple bright.<br>
          And my foe beheld it shine,<br>
          And he knew that it was mine.</p>

          <p>And into my garden stole,<br>
          When the night had veild the pole;<br>
          In the morning glad I see;<br>
          My foe outstretched beneath the tree.</p>

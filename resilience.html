          <p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
          <span class="indent">Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,</span><br>
          If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
          <span class="indent">But make allowance for their doubting too;</span></p>

          <p>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
          <span class="indent">Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,</span><br>
          Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br>
          <span class="indent">And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:</span></p>

          <p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
          <span class="indent">If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;</span><br>
          If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
          <span class="indent">And treat those two impostors just the same;</span></p>

          <p>If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>
          <span class="indent">Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</span><br>
          Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
          <span class="indent">And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:</span></p>

          <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
          <span class="indent">And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</span><br>
          And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
          <span class="indent">And never breathe a word about your loss;</span></p>

          <p>If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
          <span class="indent">To serve your turn long after they are gone,</span><br>
          And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
          <span class="indent">Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'</span></p>

          <p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
          <span class="indent">Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,</span><br>
          If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
          <span class="indent">If all men count with you, but none too much;</span></p>

          <p>If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
          <span class="indent">With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,</span><br>
          Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>
          <span class="indent">And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son!</span></p>

          <p>This visualization represents the themes of Kipling's poem through abstract particle interactions:</p>
          
          <p><strong>Colors and Meanings:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>White particles represent composure and clarity</li>
            <li>Blue particles symbolize resilience and stability</li>
            <li>Orange particles show strength and determination</li>
            <li>Purple particles embody wisdom and understanding</li>
            <li>Green particles illustrate balance and harmony</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Interactive Elements:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Move your mouse to interact with the particles</li>
            <li>Particles resist external forces based on their inner strength</li>
            <li>Connections between particles represent relationships and balance</li>
            <li>Press 'p' to pause/resume the animation</li>
            <li>Press 'r' to reset the particles</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Visual Metaphors:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The circular formation represents wholeness and completeness</li>
            <li>Particle trails show the passage of time and experience</li>
            <li>Inner strength is visualized through resistance to external forces</li>
            <li>Connections between particles illustrate the poem's themes of balance and relationships</li>

          <p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
          <span class="indent">Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,</span><br>
          If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
          <span class="indent">But make allowance for their doubting too;</span></p>

          <p>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
          <span class="indent">Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,</span><br>
          Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br>
          <span class="indent">And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:</span></p>

          <p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
          <span class="indent">If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;</span><br>
          If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
          <span class="indent">And treat those two impostors just the same;</span></p>

          <p>If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>
          <span class="indent">Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</span><br>
          Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
          <span class="indent">And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:</span></p>

          <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
          <span class="indent">And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</span><br>
          And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
          <span class="indent">And never breathe a word about your loss;</span></p>

          <p>If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
          <span class="indent">To serve your turn long after they are gone,</span><br>
          And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
          <span class="indent">Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'</span></p>

          <p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
          <span class="indent">Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,</span><br>
          If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
          <span class="indent">If all men count with you, but none too much;</span></p>

          <p>If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
          <span class="indent">With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,</span><br>
          Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>
          <span class="indent">And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son!</span></p>

          <p>This dynamic interpretation of "If—" represents the poem's themes through an interactive particle system that embodies resilience, wisdom, and balance:</p>
          
          <p><strong>Particle Types and Meanings:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Particles (White):</strong> Represent inner strength and purity of purpose, forming the stable center of the system</li>
            <li><strong>Shield Particles (Blue):</strong> Symbolize protection and stability, creating a resilient barrier around the core</li>
            <li><strong>Flow Particles (Orange):</strong> Embody adaptability and energy, moving dynamically through the system</li>
            <li><strong>Wisdom Particles (Purple):</strong> Represent knowledge and understanding, creating connections between different aspects</li>
            <li><strong>Balance Particles (Green):</strong> Illustrate harmony and growth, maintaining equilibrium in the system</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Interactive Features:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mouse Movement:</strong> Interact with particles to create dynamic patterns and observe their resistance to external forces</li>
            <li><strong>Click Patterns:</strong> Each click cycles through five different arrangements:
              <ul>
                <li>Concentric rings that organize particles by their roles</li>
                <li>Spiral formations that create flowing, dynamic patterns</li>
                <li>Wave patterns that demonstrate adaptability and movement</li>
                <li>Type-based clusters that group similar particles together</li>
                <li>Explosion patterns that show the system's response to change</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Continuous States:</strong> The system naturally cycles through different formations:
              <ul>
                <li>Concentric circles representing structured harmony</li>
                <li>Spiral formations showing growth and evolution</li>
                <li>Wave patterns illustrating adaptability</li>
                <li>Dynamic clusters demonstrating balance and connection</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Visual Metaphors:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The particle system represents the complex interplay of virtues described in the poem</li>
            <li>Core particles' resistance to external forces mirrors the poem's theme of inner strength</li>
            <li>Dynamic patterns and transitions symbolize the continuous journey of self-improvement</li>
            <li>Particle connections illustrate the importance of balance and relationships</li>
            <li>The system's ability to reorganize and adapt reflects the poem's message of resilience</li>
          </ul>

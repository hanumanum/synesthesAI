        <h1 id="poem-title">If—</h1>
        <div id="poem-author">— Rudyard Kipling</div>
        <div id="poem-text">
          <p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
          Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
          If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
          But make allowance for their doubting too;</p>

          <p>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
          Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br>
          Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br>
          And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>

          <p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
          If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
          If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
          And treat those two impostors just the same;</p>

          <p>If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>
          Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
          Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
          And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:</p>

          <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
          And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
          And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
          And never breathe a word about your loss;</p>

          <p>If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
          To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
          And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
          Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'</p>

          <p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
          Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br>
          If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
          If all men count with you, but none too much;</p>

          <p>If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
          With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br>
          Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>
          <span class="indent">And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son!</span></p>
